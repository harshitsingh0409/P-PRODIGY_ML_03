# Cat-Dog Image Classification using SVM
## Overview
  This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to accurately distinguish between the two categories     based on image data.

## Tools & Technologies
  Python
  OpenCV for image preprocessing
  Scikit-Learn for implementing the SVM model
  Matplotlib for visualizing the results
## Dataset
  The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, which are preprocessed and used to train the SVM model.

## Key Insights
  A critical role of image preprocessing and feature extraction.
  Strengths of SVM in handling high-dimensional data.
  Importance of parameter tuning (e.g., kernel choice).

## Results
  The SVM model achieves robust classification performance, accurately distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. Visualizations demonstrate the model's             effectiveness.
